    Hello! I am Gautami Basutkar.
    I am a Grad Student pursuing Informations System from Northeastern University, Oakland. I am currently in my second semester and Web Design and User Experience is one of the courses I will be taking this semester.

    I did my undergrad from G. Narayanamma Institute of Technology and Sciences, Hyderabad. I also worked as an Assosciate Software Engineer at Micron Technologies and gained some experience in the Supply Chain Department. I am keen on doing Front end developing and learning Web Designing would help me enhance user experience. My expectation from this course would be to be able to learn new skills related to web designing and make a user friendly interface that can be understood by everyone.
